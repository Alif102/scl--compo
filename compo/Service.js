We will do everything needed to design and create your new school website design.  All you have to do is provide the content (text, images etc.) for your website and we will do the rest</p>

                          <p className='ser-p1'>When you're ready to get started we will send you a content form where you can add your school information and text for each website page.  We will also provide you with access to our secure portal where you can upload all of the images and files for your school website.</p>

                          <p className='ser-p1'>From there we will create the initial design for you to review.  We want to create a site that you will love and to do that we listen to you. Once we have addressed any design requests we will move on to building your website and adding all of your pages and content.</p>

                          <p className='ser-p1'>As soon as the site is built we will notify you to review it again and then move to the testing phase. We test your school website on different browsers and devices to ensure it works well everywhere.  When we have completed the testing phase we will connect your new school website to your domain.</p>
